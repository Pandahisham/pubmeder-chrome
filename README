"PubMed-er : ease your paper reading in browser"
------

NOTE: When install, you will receive the message "This extension will have access to your browsing history and private data on all websites" because the extension uses a content script (http://goo.gl/59WQ), which is why you receive that message. This extension does NOT access to your private data!

In Current Version: 
 + recording is working (except inside Gmail, Cell Press Future Article Interface, or any other webpage using AJAX to fetch data)

The goal of this extension is to record all the literature you read in chrome, and upload to an app engine powered website http://pubmeder.appspot.com for future retrieve. I have also developed add-on/extension/script for other modern browsers. You can get them from http://en.dogeno.us/pubmeder .

By the way, PubMed-er has been integrated with "the Paper Link" at http://www.thepaperlink.com, as the tool to bookmark recent read papers.
